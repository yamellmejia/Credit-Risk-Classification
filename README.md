# Credit-Risk-Classification

# Overview
This project utilizes logistic regression to predict the risk of loans (healthy vs. high-risk) using historical lending data. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify loans based on their risk status, helping the company assess creditworthiness.

# Steps
1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file containing loan data.

2. Data Preprocessing: The data is split into features (X) and labels (y), and further divided into training and testing sets.

3. Model Creation: A logistic regression model is trained using the training data.

4. Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using a confusion matrix and classification report.

Results
Accuracy: 99%

Precision (healthy loans): 1.00

Recall (high-risk loans): 0.94

F1-Score (high-risk loans): 0.90

# Conclusion
The logistic regression model performs excellently, with a high accuracy rate and balanced precision and recall for both healthy and high-risk loans. The model is suitable for predicting loan risk in real-world scenarios.
